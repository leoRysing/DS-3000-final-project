    "#### Executive Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project saw us analyzing various metrics about university tuitions, types, and student enrollment demographics to try to understand if growing college tuitions have cut down on how diverse colleges can be. We chose to do this project because as college students, we are keenly aware of just how much our education costs, and are concerned with growing inequality in America that self-perpetuates through systematic lack of access to resources. We found our data from Kaggle from the user Jesse Mostipak, with her College tuition, diversity, and pay dataset. We combined this data into a 26 column, 9000 row dataset, onto which we planned to run knn, lasso, and ridge regression. After feature selection, standardization, and hyperparameter tuning, we found that knn fit best, and the linear based models did not work very well for our data. In our discussion, we mainly noted that the conclusions we drew were much more nuanced and weaker than we had anticipated. We also wanted to go back and check more  non linear models for our dataset, because we saw that our data did not fit a linear model very well."

    "<h4>Problem Statement</h4>\n",
    " \n",
    "For our project, we wanted to tackle the issue of college tuition being a possible hindrance for diversity on campus, especially for groups who on average fall more closely in lower income brackets. As university students, we wanted to do this project because we have felt that tuition costs have been growing tremendously in the past years, and we wanted to see the actual effects this raised tuition has on university demographics. In effect, our topic is an analysis of student tuition by income bracket and how it affects the student body population.\n",
    " \n",
    "Our first objective is primarily to explore the relationship between different college tuitions, university types, and total student enrollment influences demographic breakdowns of students. The second objective is to see and note which range of tuition blocks, if any, provide a much more balanced student body.\n",
    " \n",
    "<h4>Significance of the Problem</h4>\n",
    " \n",
    "It is important to tackle this, because college is often seen as a requirement step for many jobs today,\n",
    "but this doesn’t mean that everybody is able to make use of this incredibly important resource. Because of the rapidly inflating tuition, we want to see if tuition are still reasonable for the majority of Americans, as well as to predict how\n",
    "movement in diverse student bodies impacts this as well.\n",
    " \n",
    "We want to see if increased debt from increased costs might be hampering certain factors that decide\n",
    "who can go to college. It might also be useful to argue in favor of adding more control towards college\n",
    "tuition. Depending on the findings we get, it might provide evidence for student activists and universities that claim to wish to foster diversity on campus to control tuition. At the very least, it might help keep eyes on this issue, and add pressure for administrations when they decide on tuition costs.\n",
    " \n",
    "<h4>Questions</h4>\n",
    " \n",
    "Based on the importance of the issue of rising college tuition and diversity on college campuses, we hope to answer the following questions through analyzing out data:\n",
    "- Which factors (income breakdown, location, price, in-state and out-of-state enrollment, etc) have an impact on racial diversity on college campuses?\n",
    "- Does the cost of a college or university play into how diverse its campus will be?\n",
    "- Does the race of a student impact the college they choose to attend?\n",
    "- Do different groups get impacted by the features the same way?\n",
    "- Which regression model best illustrates the relationship between different attributes of a university and its diversity?\n",
    " \n",
    "<h4>Hypotheses</h4>\n",
    " \n",
    "- Hypothesis about features:\n",
    "   - Null: Various attributes of colleges and universities, such as income, cost, location, and degrees offered, will have no impact on the racial diversity of universities. In addition, race will have no impact on the type of college a student will attend.\n",
    "   - Alternate: Features such as the average income of the students at a university, types of degrees offered, location, and enrollment size will play a role in the diversity of a university. In addition, the cost of a university will affect its diversity, and race will impact what universities students gravitate toward.\n",
    "- Hypothesis about machine learning algorithm:\n",
    "   - Null: Each machine learning algorithm we use (K-Nearest Neighbors, Lasso, and Ridge) will perform equally well on our data, and using one over the other will have no impact on the overall results.\n",
    "   - Alternate: K-Nearest Neighbors will be the best machine learning algorithm for prediction on our model, and will produce the best results out of our three regression models.\n",
    "- Hypothesis about impact of features of target demographics;\n",
    "   - Null: Various attributes of colleges and universities, such as income, cost, location, and degrees offered, will not impact different racial and ethnic student applicants any differently, so student racial group sizes will be uniformly impacted\n",
    "   - Alternate: Various attributes of colleges and universities, such as income, cost, location, and degrees offered, will impact the different racial and ethnic groups we looked at differently, reflecting diverse cultural, socio-economic, and environmental concerns"

    "We are going to be predicting the expected student body size for 5 specific demographics (White students, African American students, Hispanic students, Indigenous students, and Asian-American students). In  other words, given the data about various school tuition prices for different income brackets, school type, on campus status, total enrollment, and state location, we will be predicting the expected number of students at that school of each of the selected demographic bodies. For our prediction, we will use the above collection of features to train our model (after some slight standardization). We think these are important predictors, because if we can reliably predict them, then we can play around to see which combination of tuition costs can maximize diversity on campus.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### A Supervised Learning Problem\n",
    "This is a supervised learning problem, since features are named, and we are not looking to cluster results. It is subcategorized to a regression problem - we are seeking to obtain a/some continuous output variable(s).\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Machine Learning Algorithms To Be Applied\n",
    "We will be using Lasso, KNN, and Ridge regression models. We are however somewhat sceptical of linear fit in our model; this is why we have chosen to include kNN regression. We chose these three, because Lasso and Ridge are fairly robust linear models, and kNN is the main algorithm we could think of that didn't directly regress using linear regression. We originally looked at polynomial regression and SVM regression, but realized that both of those did not really fit our data."

    "In these figures, we plotted the counts of each total university price, in dollars, first for For Profit institutions, then for Public institutions, and finally for Private schools. This was done in order to see the distribution of these values, in order to gage normally and sway. Private and public universities saw noticeable sway (in opposite directions), but were still in the form of a bell curve. For profit institutions were much less bell curve-esque, but this can be attributed to their rarity. We notice a peak in between 40000 and 50000 dollars for private universities, and a peak around 20000 for public universities. Notably, this follows the common trend that Public universities are less expensive than private institutions."

    "These 6 figures are a further exploration of tuition cost distributions for the bottom 3 income brackets we looked at, for private and public schools. These visualizations tell us that tuition for neither school types are normally distributed, but private schools are much closer to this. Public schools holistically showed peaks around 20K dollars, with noticeable right skew while private schools had peaks closer to 50K, with slight left skew, likely attributing to the few private institutions whose brand identity and immense pull means that they are able to meet \"100% of demonstrated financial need\"."

In the first 10 states displayed, the 2016 tuitions seem to be higher than their 2017 and 2018 counterparts. In contrast, for the rest of the other 50 states, tuition seems to have increased from 2016 to 2018, with the peaks and ranges consistently being slightly above their previous year counterparts. The ranges themselves also show striking similarity in most states showing that universities likely strategically set their prices based on their given types. This takeaway is at most inference; the nature of this graph, with the averages, does somewhat cut off some important information, since private and public universities have drastically different price tags by design. The largest takeaway from this graph is that on a year to year basis, prices are not crazily increasing, but that in most states college prices are starting to reach up and up."

    "The idea with these visualizations here is to see how our selected features correlate with each other, for the specific target variables. The main takeaways that can be taken by looking at them as a group is that interestingly, each group ended up selecting different collections of features. While all of them had some overlap, there were distinct patterns and idiosyncrasies, like the Asian American and White target models selecting state and off campus price as relevant metrics, while the other three target models did not select those features as being significant for fit. The African American, Hispanic, and Indigenous models also showed remarkable similarity in their correlations as well, in the same way that The Asian American and White models matched up. These selected features were also decently correlated in the positive direction, much more so than the original heatmap. Much more of these features can be categorized as being moderate to strong."

    "The visualization here is a collection of scatterplots comparing net cost in the 0 to 30 thousand income bracket vs the proportion of the student body that is a part of the target demographic (target / total enrollment). What we were looking for was seeing what effect increasing net tuition for students in the lowest income bracket would affect the proportion of students of our target demographics. Our conclusions were definitely interesting. For starters, it was not as clear cut that increased tuition definitely correlated to lower proportions. While 3 of the targets (2, 3, and 4 for private schools, 1, 4, and 5 for public schools), the other 2 targets for each school type saw their proportion on campus increase, although very minimally, as tuitions where raised. In terms of magnitude, the negative impact was somewhat stronger than the positive increase. It is however interesting to note how visually, the highest proportions of students where found closer to slightly left of the median net cost, suggesting that keeping costs steady, with slight decreases, for the 0 to 20k income bracket would help increase the proportion of students of said demographic at the schools. The other interesting thing of note is that there was a very small linear fit; some of the scatter plots definitely reflected that a different model of fit would match them much more closely. It is also very hard to tell because of the peculiar shapes of the graphs, but it does look like public schools did perform better at keeping high proportions of the underrepresented student groups, if ever so slightly. What this exactly signifies is a bit ambiguous; it might mean that public schools in general are more representative because they are federally connected, or it might mean that their tuition amounts are much more appealing or manageable to poc students."

    "### Summary\n",
    " \n",
    "To analyze our dataset, we first adjusted our feature variables to all be represented numerically. We used one shared feature dataset for each target, which we later selected 12 from for each target. We then visualized relationships between total enrollment and total tuition, and price for the bottom 3 income brackets in order to see the distributions and patterns present for universities of different sizes. This confirmed for us that public and private schools had distinct patterns of tuition, with public universities being holistically on average less expensive than private universities. We also examined if increased size led to increased tuition (small correlation), overall relationship between all the features, and a breakdown of total university tuition over the last 3 years by state. We expected a much larger divide over the years that was more uniform than the resulting line graph showed for us. We then visualized correlation for our selected features, which let us know that our different targets were impacted differently by the features. To run our regression models, we evaluated three different supervised learning regression models. We then optimized the regression models that would best eliminate overfitting of our data, noticing that our assumption that linear regression was not the best fit. As such, we hypertuned our kNN model, finding the best parameters to be 3 neighbors, and euclidean or manhattan distance (depending on the target). This resulted in improved accuracy, (0.776, 0.812, 0.624, 0.777, and 0.628 for targets 1, 2  3, 4 and 5).\n",

    "and performed even better after feature selection (training%/testing% | Asian: 71.0/64.6, Black: 75.2/50.9, Hispanic: 67.9/46.0, Native American/Alaskan: 69.9/54.7, White: 78.7/67.2). Note that testing performances increased dramatically.\n",
    " \n",
    "Both the Lasso and Ridge models performed extremely poorly, with their performance decreasing even further after variable selection was implemented.

    "#### Model Tuning and Evaluation\n",
    " \n",
    "After tuning our models, both Ridge and Lasso models did not show significant improvements in performance. On the other hand, while tuning the KNeighborRegressor model for the number of neighbors and distance metric, the performances with the testing set significantly increased. Thus, we chose to focus on the kNN regression model which was optimized at 3 neighbors for all targets and either manhattan or euclidean distance (respectively)\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Algorithms for Use in Predictive Model\n",
    " \n",
    "As our project contains many different types of features that are very much categorical (all OneHotEncoded variables), we decided to use the KNeighborsRegressor to derive a plausible enrollment count at a university for a demographic within a standardized data set. Using surrounding values, it can better predict enrollment rather than trying to minimize the effects of lesser features. From there, we had a bit of debate about the other two models. We weren't sure about a linear fit for our model - as such, we were kind of stumped, because most of the models we covered in depth were based on linear regression. We settled on Ridge and Lasso regression because we wanted to minimize the effect of lesser features as much as we could, in order to try and get as much sense of our model as we could.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "### Research questions\n",
    " \n",
    "Can you determine a university's demographic breakdown just by looking at its costs? For some demographic more than others\n",
    " \n",
    "***Which factors (income breakdown, location, price, in-state and out-of-state enrollment, etc) have an impact on racial diversity on college campuses?***\n",
    " \n",
    "We found that different target demographics were impacted by different features. We found that each instance of feature selection had the private and public university features, alongside the net cost for the bottom 3 income brackets, and total price. Some models had other income brackets, two target groups (Asian American and white) also selected state as an important feature. Room and board cost, in-state tuition, and out-of-state tuition were other common selected features, which some targets felt were important, and others didn't.\n",
    " \n",
    "We also found that there were two main visual patterns for our groups. As noted above, white and asian american enrollment seemed tied to very similar features, while African American, Indigenous, and Hispanic enrollment more closely matched with each other.\n",
    " \n",
    "***Does the cost of a college or university play into how diverse its campus will be?***\n",
    " \n",
    "This seems to currently be a tentative maybe, or a yes with limitations. All of the models selected total price and some form of net cost and other financial breakdown as being important to predicting diversity, as defined in the data analysis section (diversity as number of students of various demographics). However, from our visualizations, we can see that there isn't a strong negative linear correlation between the two. As of now it seems plausible that there is some connection between higher prices tetering diversity, but we need to apply more metrics to these combinations of feature and combo before we answer this question.\n",
    " \n",
    "***Does the race of a student impact the college they choose to attend?***\n",
    " \n",
    "Our data analysis did not specifically bring about an answer to this question. What we know is that each target group had different graphical patterns in our scatterplot, showing that public and private schools pulled students of different racial and ethnic backgrounds to differing degrees.\n",
    " \n",
    "***Do different groups get impacted by the features the same ways?***\n",
    " \n",
    "This is a definitive yes. As we saw from our feature selection, different features/ factors were selected as statistically significant for our models between the different target sets. No target group had exactly the same collection of most important features. On top of this, the additional takeaway can be made that although all the groups do not share a uniform impact with the features, there were certain overall patterns for which features different target groups followed (White and asian american target models showed this in their collection of 2-3 variables witch close to no linear correlation, one of which was the state of the university).\n",
    " \n",
    "***Which regression model best illustrates the relationship between different attributes of a university and its diversity?***\n",
    " \n",
    "As we predicted in our hypothesis, the kNN regression model illustrated the relationship between the attributes and university diversity. It was the only training model that was able to break through a 50% accuracy for our regression, and the only one that could account for more than 60% of the variation of our data (Linear and Ridge each accounted for under 20%).\n",
    " \n",
    "### Reflecting on Our Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Tying back to our original signifcance, we wanted to see impacts of tuition information on diversity on campus, to see if raising tuitions are hurting efforts to overcome systematic differences different groups in America face. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the results we got, we cannot strongly conclude a linear negative correlation between higher tuition and decreased representation on campuses. It appears to have at most a weak, small, linear correlation in some places, but the data shows a very non linear form. \n",
    " \n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Our main conclusion, as outlined above, is that while it seems to be possible to predict how many students of a target group will enroll in a school based on the features we selected, a non linear model would be likely able to communicate more information and much more closely fit our data. We found slight evidence that expensive costs somewhat deter diversity (as defined by proportion of students of a target group present at a university), but we would need to here as well look at it with a fit model different from linear regression. We unfortunately were not able to strongly answer our question about race impacting what university a student would attend, since our data model did not use race as a feature. \n",
    " \n",
    "For the future, the main things we wanted to do was look at data from more years potentially, to actually get an analysis of effects of rising costs over the years. We also wanted to connect our data with data showing state demographic data, to see which type of school (public or private) is more representative of a given state. The biggest major extension we would want to do is find more non linear regression models we could apply to fit our data with, to actually compare different models that would be able to somewhat fit our data."
